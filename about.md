In <time datetime="1999">1999</time> I created the Scottish and Celtic music specialist retail website [Music Scotland](https://www.musicscotland.com/).  I ran this business as owner-manager from locations in Edinburgh, Stirling and the Isle of Mull.  In <time datetime="2005">2005</time> the business won the <span itemprop="award">Scots Trad Music Awards Services To Industry Award</span>.  In <time datetime="2011">2011</time> it was sold as a going concern to another Scottish music store, Oban Music, and still trades today.  Music Scotland has sent CDs, DVDs and books to tens of thousands of customers worldwide, most of this music created by Scottish artists.

Since <time datetime="2011">2011</time> I've worked freelance, creating and/or supporting an operational web presence for a wide range of [client businesses](/clients).  These have included record companies and other online retailers, accommodation providers, agricultural suppliers and medical-scientific organisations.

For two years from <time datetime="2017">2017</time> I was part of the Webteam at the [University of the Highlands and Islands](https://www.uhi.ac.uk/en/), working on the University's content management system, supporting users and developing the front end of the website.

In a former life I was a musician, performing internationally with [Salsa Celtica](https://salsaceltica.com) and other bands, and teaching Scottish traditional music with [Feisean Nan Gaidheal](https://feisean.org/). 

In an even former life, [Edinburgh University](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) gave me a degree in Biochemistry.
