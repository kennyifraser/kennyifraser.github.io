I went to school at [Fortrose Academy](https://www.fortroseacademy.co.uk/) on the Black Isle, and during the early 1990s gained a degree in biochemistry at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

In <time datetime="1999">1999</time> I created the Scottish and Celtic music specialist retail website [Music Scotland](https://www.musicscotland.com/).  I ran this business as owner-manager from locations in Edinburgh, Stirling and the Isle of Mull.  In <time datetime="2005">2005</time> the business won the <span itemprop="award">Scots Trad Music Awards Services To Industry Award</span>.  In <time datetime="2011">2011</time> it was sold as a going concern to another Scottish music store, Oban Music, and still trades today.  Music Scotland has sent CDs, DVDs and books to tens of thousands of customers worldwide, most of this music created by Scottish artists.

During the 2000s I was also working as a musician, performing internationally with [Salsa Celtica](https://salsaceltica.com) and other bands, and teaching Scottish traditional music with the Gaelic cultural organisation [Feisean Nan Gaidheal](https://feisean.org/).

In 2008 I converted my music shop in Tobermory into a self catering holiday property, [Back Brae Lodge](https://mull.co).  Since then, the house has accommodated hundreds of guests visiting the Isle of Mull. 

Between <time datetime="2011">2011</time> and <time datetime="2022">2022</time> I worked freelance as a web designer and developer, creating and/or supporting an operational web presence for a wide range of [small business clients](/clients).  These included record companies and other online retailers, accommodation providers, agricultural suppliers and medical-scientific organisations.

Between <time datetime="2017">2017</time> and <time datetime="2017">2019</time> I was part of the web team at the [University of the Highlands and Islands](https://www.uhi.ac.uk/en/), working on the University's content management system, supporting users and developing the front end of the site.
