# Kenny Fraser
    
I live on the bonnie Black Isle, near Inverness in the Scottish Highlands.

I've mainly built websites as a [career](/about), and travelled Scotland and other parts of the world playing Scottish music. 
  
I also host holiday guests at Back Brae Lodge, a [self catering cottage in Tobermory](https://mull.co) on the Isle of Mull.
