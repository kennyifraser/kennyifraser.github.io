# Kenny Fraser
    
I live on the bonnie Black Isle, near Inverness in the Scottish Highlands.

As a [career](/about/) I've helped build and manage websites, and travelled the world with bands playing music. 

I've recently taken up the post of Web Manager at [NHS Highland](https://www.nhshighland.scot.nhs.uk/).
  
[//]: # (Our small team hosts holiday guests at Back Brae Lodge, a [self catering cottage in Tobermory]&#40;https://mull.co/&#41; on the Isle of Mull.)

I'm one third of the [Black Isle Ceilidh Band](https://blackisle.band/).
