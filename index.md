# Kenny Fraser
    
I live on the bonnie Black Isle, near Inverness in the Scottish Highlands.

I've been the Web Manager at [NHS Highland](https://www.nhshighland.scot.nhs.uk/) since August 2022.

I'm one third of the [Black Isle Ceilidh Band](https://blackisle.band/).

As a [career](/about) I've built and managed websites, run a self catering property on the Isle of Mull, and travelled the world with bands playing music.
