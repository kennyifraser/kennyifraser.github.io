# Kenny Fraser
    
I live on the bonnie Black Isle, near Inverness in the Scottish Highlands.

As a [career](/about) I've built websites for other people, and travelled the world playing music. 
  
I host holiday guests at Back Brae Lodge, a [self catering cottage in Tobermory](https://mull.co) on the Isle of Mull.
