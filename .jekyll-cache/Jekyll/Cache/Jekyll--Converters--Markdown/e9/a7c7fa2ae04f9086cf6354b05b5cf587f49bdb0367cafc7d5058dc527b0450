I"o<p>What I wanted was <em>https://kennyfraser.com</em> to be the definitive URL of this site, and <a href="http://www.kennyfraser.com/">https://www.kennyfraser.com</a> to redirect there.</p>

<p><a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">Using the instructions here</a> I had to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-pages-site-repository/">add a CNAME <em>file</em> to my GitHub User repository</a> as well as <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-subdomain/">configure a CNAME <em>record</em></a> at the DNS service provider (Fasthosts).</p>

<p>The GitHub CNAME file contents are just:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">kennyfraser.com</code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Don’t make this mistake</strong> in the DNS provider’s CNAME records:</p>

<p><img src="/img/CNAME-records-fasthosts-github-pages.png" alt="CNAME records at Fasthosts" /></p>

<p>Using a blank hostname in the CNAME records can mess up the MX routing for email, and possibly other services.</p>

<p>The <em>www</em> Host Name CNAME record points to my <em>username.github.io</em>. This is the recommended <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages">custom subdomain</a> for best performance.</p>

<p>Two <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">A Records for the apex <em>(non-www)</em> domain</a> with Github IP addresses are also necessary.  GitHub Pages <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain-and-www-subdomain/">automatically creates a redirect</a> between the <em>www</em> and <em>non-www</em> versions of the domain, depending on the contents of the CNAME <em>file</em>.</p>
