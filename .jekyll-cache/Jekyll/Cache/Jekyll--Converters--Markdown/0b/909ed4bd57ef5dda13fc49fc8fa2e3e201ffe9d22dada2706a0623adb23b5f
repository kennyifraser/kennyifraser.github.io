I"<p><a href="//statamic.com">Statamic</a> is a flat-file, <a href="//laravel.com/">Laravel</a>-based content management system built and supported by <a href="//wilderborn.com/">Wilderborn</a> (<a href="//twitter.com/jackmcdade">Jack McDade</a>, <a href="//twitter.com/jason_varga">Jason Varga</a> and <a href="//twitter.com/garethredfern">Gareth Redfern</a>).  It’s great to work with.  I had the opportunity to upgrade a v1 site this week, so here’s my tuppence-worth.</p>

<p>The Statamic v2 documentation is excellent, taking the form of <a href="//docs.statamic.com/guides">Trail Guides</a> as walk-through processes, and <a href="//docs.statamic.com/reference">Reference</a> for the specific ingredients.  It’s written in a conversational style with a liberal sprinkling of unselfconscious humour…</p>

<p>Overall it’s a case of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>setting up a clean v2 installation, which includes example content</li>
  <li>removing the example content and files (optional)</li>
  <li>transferring v1 files across in a sensible order - no database to worry about</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="v2-installation">v2 Installation</h2>

<p><a href="//docs.statamic.com/guides/getting-started">Getting Started With Statamic</a> walks through setting up Statamic v2, and there’s a <a href="https://vimeo.com/165632057">useful video on Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p><a href="//www.mamp.info/en/">Mamp Pro</a> was the tool of choice for my local installation.</p>

<p>To configure URL rewrites, the sample <em>.htaccess</em> file should really be used so <em>/index.php/</em> is removed from resulting URLs.</p>

<p>The <em>installer.php</em> file can be run locally to check requirements and set up a few handy things.  This seemed to cleverly delete itself after running locally, so I had to find it again to copy it up to the production server to check that.  For the production site I’m transferring hosts to get the required <em>PHP &gt;= 5.5.9</em> version, though this wasn’t unexpected and not a big deal, with performance improvements also on offer at the new host.  <em>Zip archive support for updater backups</em> failed on production, and <em>always_populate_raw_post_data=-1</em> on both production and local.  Not to worry, for now at least.</p>

<p>System files can be <a href="//docs.statamic.com/reference/recipes/secure-installation">moved above webroot</a> for additional security.  There’s a bit of extra work there in adjusting default paths in settings files.</p>

<p>The one-click updater tool in v2 is a potentially great time-saving addition.</p>

<h2 id="clear-site-to-remove-v2-example-files">Clear Site to Remove v2 Example Files</h2>

<p>There’s a handy wee command line instruction to do this, with options:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="n">php</span> <span class="n">please</span> <span class="n">clear</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">site</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/164430243">Best described in this video</a>.  It can also create a new theme skeleton for you.</p>

<p>This is optional and can be done after importing your v1 site, as I did after Jack pointed out the video.  However since it wipes <strong>all</strong> <em>/themes/</em>, <em>/collections/</em> and /<em>pages</em>/ subdirectories, in retrospect I’d recommend instead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>set up and play locally with the example files on a complete v2 site</li>
  <li>set up a fresh v2 site and run Clear Site before the next v1 site import step</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t choose to Clear Site, example content <em>/pages/</em> and <em>/collections/</em> subdirectory names can be prefixed with an underscore to hide but retain them for future reference.</p>

<h2 id="moving-v1-files">Moving v1 Files</h2>

<p><a href="//docs.statamic.com/guides/upgrading-from-v1">You Can Get Here From There</a> clears a path through the undergrowth for an upgrade from v1.</p>

<p>The v2 Control Panel is now located at <em>http://yourdomain/cp/</em> - this nugget tucked away in the docs under <em>New Defaults</em>. So <em>Tools : Import</em> then <em>Import content from Statamic v1</em> instructs you to download an <em>exporter</em> add-on for installation into your <strong>v1</strong> site.  Visit the generated URL for a JSON string which can be pasted back into your v2 control panel.  The result was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>v1 <em>Entries</em> were taken in as new v2 <em>Collections</em></li>
  <li><em>Pages</em> are transformed to their v2 equivalents</li>
</ul>

<p>Nice.</p>

<p>A few variables had to be renamed for the site to start working again - for example:</p>

<p>{{ layout_content }}</p>

<p>…becomes:</p>

<p>{{ template_content }}</p>

<p>…and underscores needed removed from various variables.</p>

<p>The custom theme from the <em>/themes/</em> directory had to be moved across manually.  Assets can be similarly copied across from the v1 <em>/assets/</em> directory to the corresponding v2 location.</p>

<p>Optionally (as <em>entries:listing</em> is backwards-compatible), the main change here is renaming <em>entries</em> in the template code:</p>

<p>{{ entries:listing folder=”example” }}…{{ /entries:listing }}</p>

<p>… as <em>collections</em>:</p>

<p>{{ collection:example }}…{{ /collection:example }}</p>

<hr />

<p>That was it!  Up and running locally with v2.  The original v1 site wasn’t enormously complicated but I guess the principles would probably remain the same if it had been.  The main process just took a couple of hours as a first attempt, and the next v1 upgrade will go a lot quicker I’m sure.</p>

<p>There’s a high degree of integrity about Statamic that makes it very reassuring to work with, and their <a href="//slack.statamic.com">Slack</a> v2 support channel is very active.</p>
