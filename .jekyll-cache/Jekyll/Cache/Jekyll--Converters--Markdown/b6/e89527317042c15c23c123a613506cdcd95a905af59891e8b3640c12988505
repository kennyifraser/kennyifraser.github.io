I"@<p>Here’s a great wee tip <a href="http://cnedelcu.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/top-3-ways-to-extract-images-from-word-docx-doc-document.html">which I discovered here</a>, solving an issue which has bugged me for years.</p>

<p>If you need to extract images from a Word file that someone has supplied, at their original full resolution, just:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Open then Save it from a current version of Word as a <em>.docx</em> file</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Duplicate and rename the Word file, changing the extension from <em>.docx</em> to <em>.zip</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open the unzipped directory and navigate to <em>/filename/word/media/</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voilà! There they are.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
