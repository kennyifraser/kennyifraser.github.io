I"÷<p>I was considering moving my simple portfolio site at <em>kennyfraser.com</em> to a more streamlined publishing setup.  I wanted to get away from hand-coded HTML/CSS files and FTP, and add simple blog functionality.</p>

<p>After hearing good things about <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> via <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a> and seeing how tightly coupled it can be with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, I forged ahead.  Ironically, after beginning the installation process, my existing VPS host went down due to a power outage, taking my email forwarding with it.  No emails for more than 24 hours.  So managed to get a <em>lot</em> doneâ€¦</p>

<p>Jekyll seems to be the <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">most popular static site generator</a> out there at the moment.  Experience of building sites with the content management system <a href="http://statamic.com/">Statamic</a> has been very good so far.  Statamic needs PHP on the server but the flat file construction looks on the surface pretty similar to Jekyll (which doesnâ€™t require any server scripting).</p>

<p>Installation of Jekyll involved delving into the command line on OS X - I mainly used documentation at <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.11-el-capitan">Go Rails</a> (with Homebrew). <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> is also needed.</p>

<p>The advantages pretty quicky made themselves clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> for writing blog posts and page content - as it should be</li>
  <li>easily generates a local server at <em>http://localhost:4000/</em> to preview the entire site, via the command line <em>jekyll serve</em></li>
  <li>support for <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> generation of stylesheets</li>
  <li>code syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>fast performance and no database overhead</li>
</ul>

<p>My GitHub command line skills arenâ€™t yet fully formed, so Iâ€™m using <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> to commit changes to local files then sync them with GitHub Pages.  Highlights here are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>everything</em> is easily version controllable</li>
  <li>quick and easy publishing with <em>Sync</em></li>
  <li>speedy and reliable hosting</li>
</ul>

<p>Will I run into limitations later? Probably. But right now things are <em>quick and easy</em> - I like it.</p>

<p>Eduardo BouÃ§as has written a good <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators">comparison of static vs dynamic site generators</a>.</p>

<p>Treehouse has a short workshop on how to <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/create-a-jekyll-site-on-github">Create a Jekyll Site on Github</a>. This assumes that Github is doing the work in generating your site from remote source files, rather than running a local version.</p>
